        <h1>Hawaiian Pizza</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the pizza dough</h3>
        <p>
            200g/7oz strong white flour, plus extra for dusting
            <br>
            200g/7oz ‘00’ flour
            <br>
            5g/⅛oz fast-action dried yeast
            <br>
            1 tsp caster sugar
            <br>
            1 tsp salt
            <br>
            2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for greasing
            <br>
            250–300ml/7–10fl oz tepid water
        </p>
        <h3>For the topping</h3>
        <p>
            250g/9oz passata
            <br>
            pinch garlic granules
            <br>
            good pinch dried oregano
            <br>
            pinch dried chilli flakes
            <br>
            pinch caster sugar
            <br>
            125g/4½oz mozzarella, drained and torn into pieces about the size of a large olive
            <br>
            6 slices ham, cut into 2cm/¾in wide strips
            <br>
            4 tinned pineapple slices, drained and cut into chunks
            <br>
            1 green chilli, seeds removed and thinly sliced (optional)
            <br>
            salt and freshly ground black pepper
        </p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
            1. To make the pizza dough, tip both flours into a large bowl (or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook). Add the yeast, sugar and salt and mix well. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and 250ml/9fl oz tepid water; mix well, adding a little more water if the mixture looks too dry – it should be soft and slightly sticky. Knead until smooth and elastic.
            <br><br>
            2. Shape the dough into a ball and place in a large oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave at room temperature for 45 minutes–1 hour, or until doubled in size.
            <br><br>
            3. Meanwhile, prepare the topping. Pour the passata into a small saucepan, add the garlic granules, oregano and chilli flakes and season well with salt and pepper. Mix well, bring to the boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for about 4 minutes, until reduced and thickened slightly. Taste and add a pinch of sugar if needed. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.
            <br><br>
            4. Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7 and place a pizza stone or a large, heavy baking tray in the oven to heat up.
            <br><br>
            5. Dust the work surface with flour, turn the dough out of the bowl and divide in half. Shape each half into a neat ball, dust with flour and leave to rest for 5 minutes.
            <br><br>
            6. Using floured hands or a rolling pin, shape one ball of dough into a neat circle about 25cm/10in in diameter, with a slightly thicker edge. Place on a large sheet of baking paper. Spread with half of the passata, leaving a 1–2cm/½–¾in border all around. Scatter with half of the mozzarella and half of the ham and pineapple. Top with green chilli, if using, and season with pepper.
            <br><br>
            7. Slide the pizza on the baking paper onto the hot pizza stone and cook for 10–12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the toppings are bubbling. While the first pizza is cooking, prepare the second in the same way.
